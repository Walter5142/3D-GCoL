《3D Spatial Feature-Based Graph Convolutional Network Framework for Scene Classification of Land Use》

This is the tentative release address for the source code and dataset mentioned in the paper "3D Spatial Feature-Based Graph Convolutional Network Framework for Scene Classification of Land Use." Since the images in the code and dataset contain detailed geographic coordinates, which are considered sensitive information, we need additional time to remove the spatial information. Once this process is complete, we will make our dataset and code publicly accessible.
